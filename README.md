Wanna troll your friends, and spam them with emails? Use this simple python program! (MUST use a gmail account)

RUN USING PYTHON IDLE (or any other compilier you want)

Input your gmail email, and password where indicated. In case of an error, gmail most likely has blocked your request from sending through due to a security error. 
To fix this, go to https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/security and scroll down to "Less secure app access".
Since a third party program is logging into your account, Google blocks it. Simply click "Turn-on", and the program will work!

I highly reccommend going to use https://html-online.com/editor/ in order to create a message full of colors and various text. Simply copy and paste the html code into the program.

Lastly, change the 'less than' value will indicate how many times the email will be sent. By default, it is set to i<80, or 80 times the email will be sent.
I prefer using this value simply because it is the perfect amount of spam, and usually takes about 1-2 minutes to send.

ENJOY SPAMMING YOUR FRIENDS!!!
